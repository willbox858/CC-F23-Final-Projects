# Starting Project

Start your project by creating a **private** template from this
repository: <https://github.com/CC-GPR-350/a5>. Remember to:

1.  Make your repository **private**
2.  Add me as a collaborator
3.  Set your `UNITY_EMAIL`, `UNITY_PASSWORD`, and `UNITY_SERIAL` repository
    secrets

# Goal

Add a broad-phase step to your collision detection using an Octree.

# Rules

1. Create a large set of random objects with random velocities, all within the bounds of the given walls.
2. Sphere-sphere collisions can be tested as they were previously, or can be tested using an Octree
3. Pressing "C" switches back and forth between Normal collision detection and Octree collision detection

# Game Code Enhancements

1. Implement the Octree classes in Octree.cs
2. Implement the missing functions in CollisionManager.cs

# Grading

Grades will be based on the above criteria, which will be assessed
automatically using the automated tests provided with the project files.
